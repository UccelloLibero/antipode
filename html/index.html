    <h2>Latitude and Longitude</h2>
    <p>Any location on earth can be described by two numbers: latitude and longitude.</p>
<!--   About latitude   -->
    <div class="about-latitude">
      <h3>Latitude</h3>
      <p>In geography, latitude is a geographic coordinate that specifies the North-South position of a point on the Earth's surface; it is an angular disatance north or south from Equator measured through 90 degrees. On the planet Earth, lines of latitude
        are circles of different size, and are often refered to as 'parallels'. The longest is the Equator, whose latitude is zero degrees (0°). The Equator devides the planet into a Northern and Southern Hemisphere, while at the poles -- North with latitude
        of 90° (or 90°N) and South with latitude of -90° (or 90°S) the circles shrink to a point.</p>
    </div>
<!-- About longitude     -->
    <div class="about-longitude">
      <h3>Longitude</h3>
      <p>Longitude is a geographic coordinate that specifies the East-West position of a point on the Earth's surface. On the globe, lines of constant longitude are called 'meridians' and they extend from pole to pole, like the segment boundries on a peeled
        orange. Every meridian must cross the Equator. The imaginery (but very important) lines of longitude run from North Pole to the South Pole. Each is identified by the number of degrees it lies East or West of the 'prime meridian', which is in Greenwich
        England.</p>
    </div>
<!--   About antipodes   -->
    <div class="about-antipodes">
      <h3>Antipodes</h3>
      <p>In geography, the antipode of any spot on Earth is the point of Earth's surface diametrically opposite to it; the antipodes of a region similarly represent the area opposite to it. A pair of points antipodal to each other are situated such that a
        straight line connectin the two would pass through Earth's center. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipodes">More about antipodes on Wikipedia.</a>)</p>
      <p>While working on this project I learned that the line of longitude also called meridian, is derived from the Latin word 'meri', a variation of 'medius' which denotes 'middle' and 'diem' meaning 'day'. The word once meant 'noon' and times of the day
        before noon were known as 'ante meridian', while times after noon were known as 'post meridian'. It is said that today's abbreviations a.m. and p.m. come from these terms, and the Sun at noon was said to be 'passing meridian'. All point on the same
        line of longitude experienced noon (and any other hour) at the same time and were therefore said to be on the same 'meridian line', which became 'meridian' for short.</p>

    <h2>About ANTIPODE Project</h2>
    <p>Antipode is my first personal project that I have been working on as a way to test my self as a developer. I've spend a year following Coursera and Edx courses that focused on fundementals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, programming in general, some of it's main concepts and touched on the posibilities of these languages being used in software development. From there I moved on to Codecademy and TreeHouse as sources for furthering my learning. I've reached a point where I wasn't sure if I was obtaining the knowledge that I was seaking. So I turned to the community meetups, especially Women Who Code and from there talking to the professionals in this field about best ways one can test them selves and their knowledge. Most of them had great advices on how to become comfortable with the fact that technology is constantly improving and changing and with that I will have to as well. Accepting this and applying it to your everyday routine is easier said than done. But once I started working on this Antipode project, it became easier to let go of the constant self doubt and actully just code. Most other projects I've built I had someones repository to refer to when it got hard but with this, that just didn't apply. </p>
    <p>You can see the full GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/UccelloLibero/antipode">here</a> for this project, how it's bulit and also ways you can use some of the back-end features in your own projects if interested.</p>

    <h3>Read more about Earth's Coordinates</h3>
    <p>If you are interested reading more about Earth's coordinates and antipode and how they're used, there is so much avaliable information. Here are links to few articles and other recourses I've relied on while building this project.</p>
    <p>Do you know that while most of the US antipodes are in the South Indian Ocean there are three spots of the continental US (one in Montana and two in Colorado) that match dry land, remote islands in Indian Ocean. Here is a fun read capturing this information
      with photos as well, <a href="https://www.usends.com/antipodes.html">US Ends.</a></p>
