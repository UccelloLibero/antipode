      <h2>Latitude and Longitude</h2>
      <p>Any location on earth can be described by two numbers: latitude and longitude.</p>
      <h3>Latitude</h3>
      <p>In geography, latitude is a geographic coordinate that specifies the North-South position of a point on the Earth's surface; it is an angular disatance north or south from Equator measured through 90 degrees. On the planet Earth, lines of latitude are circles of different size, and are often refered to as 'parallels'. The longest is the Equator, whose latitude is zero degrees (0°). The Equator devides the planet into a Northern and Southern Hemisphere. At the poles -- North with latitude of 90° (or 90°N) and South with latitude of -90° (or 90°S) the parallel circles shrink to a point.</p>
      <h3>Longitude</h3>
      <p>Longitude is a geographic coordinate that specifies the East-West position of a point on the Earth's surface. On the globe, lines of constant longitude are called 'meridians' and they extend from pole to pole, like the segment boundries on a peeled orange. Every meridian must cross the Equator. The imaginery (but very important) lines of longitude run from North Pole to the South Pole. Each is identified by the number of degrees it lies East or West of the 'prime meridian', which is in Greenwich England.</p>
      <h3>Antipodes</h3>
      <p>In geography, the antipode of any spot on Earth is the point of Earth's surface diametrically opposite to it; the antipodes of a region similarly represent the area opposite to it. A pair of points antipodal to each other are situated such that a straight line connectin the two would pass through Earth's center. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipodes">More about antipodes on Wikipedia.</a>)</p>
      <p>While working on this project I learned that the line of longitude also called meridian, is derived from the Latin word 'meri', a variation of 'medius' which denotes 'middle' and 'diem' meaning 'day'. The word once meant 'noon' and times of the day before noon were known as 'ante meridian', while times after noon were known as 'post meridian'. It is said that today's abbreviations a.m. and p.m. come from these terms, and the Sun at noon was said to be 'passing meridian'. All point on the same line of longitude experienced noon (and any other hour) at the same time and were therefore said to be on the same 'meridian line', which became 'meridian' for short.</p>

      <h3>Read more about Earth's Coordinates</h3>
      <p>If you are interested reading more about Earth's coordinates and antipode and how they're used, there is so much avaliable information. Here are links to few articles and other recourses I've relied on while building this project.</p>
      <p>Do you know that while most of the US antipodes are in the South Indian Ocean there are three spots of the continental US (one in Montana and two in Colorado) that match dry land, remote islands in Indian Ocean. Here is a fun read capturing this information with photos as well, <a href="https://www.usends.com/antipodes.html">US Ends.</a></p>
